SELECT ProductCategoryID AS Category, ProductName
FROM Production.Product
WHERE ProductCategoryID = 2
    OR ProductCategoryID = 3
    OR ProductCategoryID = 4;

#Using IN is clear and concise, and the performance of the query won't be affected.

SELECT ProductCategoryID AS Category, ProductName
FROM Production.Product
WHERE ProductCategoryID IN (2, 3, 4);

#BETWEEN
BETWEEN is another shortcut that can be used when filtering for an upper and lower bound for the value instead of using two conditions with the AND operator. The following two queries are equivalent:

SELECT ProductCategoryID AS Category, ProductName
FROM Production.Product
WHERE ListPrice >= 1.00
    AND ListPrice <= 10.00;

SELECT ProductCategoryID AS Category, ProductName
FROM Production.Product
WHERE ListPrice BETWEEN 1.00 AND 10.00;
